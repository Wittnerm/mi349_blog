        <h2>Background Info</h2>

        <p>
            I am a fifth-year Senior at Michigan state, majoring in Media and Information. I have a passion for working on and building computers and
            my goal after graduation this semester is to land a good job working as IT, preferably in Metro Detroit. My hometown is Port Huron, MI and
            I have one biological older sister and three younger step siblings. My dad is a diesel mechanic and my stepmom is a teacher.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, I love working with computers. As a side job/hobby, I build computers for friends and family. My favorite ones to build
            are gaming computers because they often have a glass windows, RGB lighting, and water cooling systems that really show off the internal
            components of the computer. This is extra challenging to build because I have to make sure the cables are nicely routed and as invisible as
            possible when viewing it from the windows. It can be tough at times, but it's always satisfying to see a new PC boot up for the first time.
            Besides building computers, my other main passions are:
