        The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is undeniably my favorite video game of all time. Skyrim is a first-person open-world RPG, where the player creates their<br>
        own avatar and traverses through an extensive world fighting and completing quests. It was released on the iconic date of 11/11/11 by Bethesda Game Studios.<br>
        For me, there are two main things that make it stand out from the other RPG competition: first being the immersion factor of the game. This can be found true<br>
        thanks to the breathtaking visuals and artwork of the world, with dialogue that is phenomenally voice acted and brilliantly composed soundtracks. The ability to<br>
        create a detailed avatar and to pick various skill sets really allows the player to be whomever they want to be and play the game suited to their playstyle.<br>
        From warrior mages to stealthy knights, you can really set the dynamic for your character based on how you play the game. Skyrim increases the immersion by<br>
        allowing players to get married in game, start a family, and even build their own house. At times, Skyrim will feel like a life simulator instead of a mere RPG.<br>
        The second advantage Skyrim has over any other RPG is the ability for anyone to create mods for the game. Mods are what has kept Skyrim fun and exciting over all<br>
        these years, as they can range from simple things like bug fixes to full-fledged, DLC-quality expansion packs made by the players themselves. The best part is<br>
        that all mods for Skyrim are available to download for free. On nexusmods.com, the most popular PC mod-hosting website, Skyrim has nearly 65 thousand unique mods<br>
        with over 1.8 billion downloads.
