                <h2>My Favorite Video Game of All Time</h2>

                The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is undeniably my favorite video game of all time. Skyrim is a first-person open-world RPG, where the player creates their
                own avatar and traverses through an extensive world fighting and completing quests. It was released on the iconic date of 11/11/11 by Bethesda Game Studios.
                For me, there are two main things that make it stand out from the other RPG competition: first being the immersion factor of the game. This can be found true
                thanks to the breathtaking visuals and artwork of the world, with dialogue that is phenomenally voice acted and brilliantly composed soundtracks. The ability to
                create a detailed avatar and to pick various skill sets really allows the player to be whomever they want to be and play the game suited to their playstyle.
                From warrior mages to stealthy knights, you can really set the dynamic for your character based on how you play the game. Skyrim increases the immersion by
                allowing players to get married in game, start a family, and even build their own house. At times, Skyrim will feel like a life simulator instead of a mere RPG.
                The second advantage Skyrim has over any other RPG is the ability for anyone to create mods for the game. Mods are what has kept Skyrim fun and exciting over all
                these years, as they can range from simple things like bug fixes to full-fledged, DLC-quality expansion packs made by the players themselves. The best part is
                that all mods for Skyrim are available to download for free. On <a rel="Nexus Mods" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">nexusmods.com</a>, the most popular PC
                mod-hosting website, Skyrim has nearly 65 thousand unique mods with over 1.8 <i>billion</i> downloads.

                <h2>Restoring Cars</h2>
                <address class="author">By <strong>Max Wittner</strong></address>

            <p>
                Restoring classic cars is a hobby of mine introduced to me by my dad. I worked in his shop as a diesel mechanic for four years and during that time, I
                gained a major appreciation and interest for mechanics. My dad loves restoring old cars in his free time, and I would often stay after work and help him
                restore his car in the shop. His favorite ride is his 1977 Monte Carlo, which has a 455 Buick big block engine that he put in it. Our current project is
                a 1973 Grand Prix, which also has a 455. At first, I did not enjoy helping him on his car because it meant I had to stay at work even longer, but after
                doing it a few times I saw the interest in it. Something about grinding down old paint and patching up rust holes with Bondo is really satisfying and even
                therapeutic. It definitely takes artistic skill and patience when repairing the body, as you have to sand and feather in the Bondo to match the car’s curves
                just right. My favorite part about restoring classic cars is working under the hood. It’s pretty awesome doing things like replacing the exhaust manifolds
                with headers and ripping down the engine to put in a beefy new cam because you can hear the difference in the roar of the engine and feel the extra horses
                when taking off.
